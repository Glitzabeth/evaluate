# Evaluate
A simple calculator that uses the basic arithmetic function
I used HTML5 , CSS3 and JavaScript (ES6 - DOM functionalities) in achieving this task.

## The calcutor uses:
*Addition (+);
*Subtration (-)
*Division(/)
*Multiplication(x)

## Pending Issues are:
*It does not reset automatically, in other to perform another evaluation, You have to press "C" to reset and "CE" to clear a value.
*It does not follow Bodmas rule, so this calculator performs one task at a time, attempting to evaluate with many functions doesnt guarantee correct answers

Its easy to navigate through with this simple functionalities
